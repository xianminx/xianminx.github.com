## Context-free grammar

G = &lt;T,N, S,R&gt;
• T is set of terminals (lexicon)  
• N is set of non-terminals For NLP, we usually distinguish out a set P ⊆ N of preterminals which always rewrite as terminals.  
• S is start symbol (one of the nonterminals)  
• R is rules/productions of the form X → α, where X is a nonterminal and α is a sequence of terminals and nonterminals (may be empty).  
• A grammar G generates a language L.
