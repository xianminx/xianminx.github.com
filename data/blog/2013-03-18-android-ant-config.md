There are 3 config files generated by `android update project` or `android update-lib-project`.

#### local.properties

```bash
lucas-mac:apf-framework lucas$ cat local.properties
```

```bash
# This file is automatically generated by Android Tools.
# Do not modify this file -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE ERASED!
#
# This file must *NOT* be checked into Version Control Systems,
# as it contains information specific to your local configuration.

# location of the SDK. This is only used by Ant
# For customization when using a Version Control System, please read the
# header note.
sdk.dir=/Users/lucas/dev/android/android-sdk-macosx
```

#### ant.properties

The ant.properties file can be created by you. It is only edited by the
'android' tool to add properties to it.
This is the place to change some Ant specific build properties.
Here are some properties you may want to change/update:

- **source.dir**  
  The name of the source directory. Default is 'src'.
  
- **out.dir**  
  The name of the output directory. Default is 'bin'.

For other overridable properties, look at the beginning of the rules
files in the SDK, at tools/ant/build.xml.

Properties related to the SDK location or the project target should
be updated using the 'android' tool with the 'update' action.

This file is an integral part of the build system for your
application and should be checked into Version Control Systems.

#### project.properties

```bash
lucas-mac:apf-framework lucas$ cat project.properties
```

```bash
# This file is automatically generated by Android Tools.
# Do not modify this file -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE ERASED!
#
# This file must be checked in Version Control Systems.
#
# To customize properties used by the Ant build system edit
# "ant.properties", and override values to adapt the script to your
# project structure.
#
# To enable ProGuard to shrink and obfuscate your code, uncomment this (available properties: sdk.dir, user.home):
#proguard.config=${sdk.dir}/tools/proguard/proguard-android.txt:proguard-project.txt

# Project target.
target=android-14
android.library=true
```

## Default `build.xml` generated by `android` tool

```bash
lucas-ma:apf-framework lucas$ cat build.xml
```

```xml
