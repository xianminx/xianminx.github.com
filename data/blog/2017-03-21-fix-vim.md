One day I updated my MacOS to Sierra, it broke a lot of toolchain on my system.

And the most importantly, VIM is broken.

```sh
➜  _posts git:(master) ✗ vim
dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/opt/ruby/lib/libruby.2.3.0.dylib
  Referenced from: /usr/local/bin/vim
  Reason: image not found
[1]    6993 abort      vim
```

Run `brew doctor` to pinpoint the issue.

```
➜  _posts git:(master) ✗ brew doctor

➜  _posts git:(master) ✗ which vim
/usr/local/bin/vim
➜  _posts git:(master) ✗ vim

Vim got fixed!
