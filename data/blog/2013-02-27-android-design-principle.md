## Design Principles

- Enchant me
  - Delight me in surprising ways
  - Real objects are more fun than buttons and menus
  - Let me make it mine
  - Get to know me

- Simplify my life
  - Keep it brief
  - Pictures are faster than words
  - Decide for me but let me have the final say
  - Only show what I need when I need it
  - I should always know where I am
  - Never lose my stuff
  - If it looks the same, it should act the same
  - Only interrupt me if it's important

- Make me amazing
  - Give me tricks that work everywhere
  - It's not my fault
  - Sprinkle encouragement
  - Do the heavy lifting for me
  - Make important things fast
