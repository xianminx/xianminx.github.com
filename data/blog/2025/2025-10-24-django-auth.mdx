- Authentication

  - who the user from the request is:
    ```python
    request.user
    ```
    This can be based on sessions(cookies), tokens, or other methods.

- Authorization
  - what the user is allowed to do
    - Permissions
    - Groups
    - Object-level permissions (e.g., Django Guardian)

## Built-in Authentication

`django.contrib.auth` provides a robust authentication system out of the box.

### User Model

Django includes a default User model with fields like username, password, email, first_name, last_name, etc. You can also create a custom user model by extending `AbstractUser` or `AbstractBaseUser`.
