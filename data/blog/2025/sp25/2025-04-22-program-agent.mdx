```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, simplify

# Problem: Suppose that the sum of the squares of two complex numbers x and y is 7, and the sum of their cubes is 10. List all possible values for x+y, separated by commas. Â 

def possible_values():
    x, y = symbols('x y')
    eq1 = Eq(x ** 2 + y ** 2, 7)
    eq2 = Eq(x**3 + y**3, 10)
    solutions = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))
    return [simplify(sol[0] + sol[1]) for sol in solutions]

print(possible_values())

```

Math / science problem as a search problem, search space is the space of all possible conjectures and experiments

### Application in Formal Verification

Example: Compiler Verification

- [sympy](https://www.sympy.org/) SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible. SymPy is written entirely in Python.
