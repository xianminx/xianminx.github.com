For years, I've maintained my blog using GitHub Pages with Jekyll. The system worked well - write in Markdown, let GitHub handle the rendering, and voilà! But recently, I caught the itch to modernize my setup with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

The turning point came when I discovered MDX - Markdown's powerful cousin that lets you embed React components directly in content. As someone who occasionally writes about interactive AI projects like my [Chinese Chess Game](https://ai-chinese-chess.vercel.app/), this opened exciting possibilities. Imagine explaining machine learning concepts with live demos, or illustrating game theory with interactive diagrams!

My initial excitement met reality when I tried extracting the documentation system from my chess project. Building a full blog engine requires:

- Post management with pagination/archives
- Category/tag systems
- Comment integration
- SEO optimization
- RSS feeds
- Dark/light mode toggles
- ...and countless other features

That's when I found the [Tailwind Next.js Starter Blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) - a template offering 90% of what I needed out of the box. After considering alternatives like [alexcarpenter's MDX theme](https://github.com/alexcarpenter/nextjs-mdx-blog-theme), this became my foundation.

## The Migration Marathon

1. **Branching Out**  
   Created a new `mdx` branch and dedicated `/blog` directory

2. **Template Setup**

   ```bash
   npx degit 'timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog'
   ```

3. **Content Migration**  
   Moved 160+ posts from `__posts` to `data/blog`, only to discover:

   - Legacy HTML/CSS in old Markdown files
   - Inconsistent frontmatter formats
   - Broken image references

4. **AI-Assisted Cleanup**  
   Built a Python script that:
   - Used OpenAI API to modernize legacy syntax
   - Standardized frontmatter fields
   - Handled 80% of conversions automatically  
     _(Available at `scripts/migration/convert_to_mdx.py`)_

The remaining 20% required manual fixes - a perfect opportunity to reacquaint myself with old content while testing the new system's limits.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Starter Templates Are Lifesavers**  
   The template's built-in features saved weeks of development time

2. **AI Co-Pilots Shine**  
   ChatGPT helped troubleshoot MDX edge cases I'd never encountered

3. **Content Debt is Real**  
   Migrating 10-year-old posts revealed outdated practices and broken links

4. **Progressive Enhancement Wins**  
   Prioritized core content migration before adding new features

## What's Next?

While the new system already supports:  
✅ Dark/light mode  
✅ Improved SEO  
✅ Responsive layouts  
✅ Social sharing

I'm eyeing future upgrades:

- Interactive code playgrounds
- Article version history
- Enhanced analytics
- Newsletter integration

This migration taught me that even established systems need occasional renovation. The process felt like moving houses - stressful in the moment, but ultimately rewarding when you settle into a better-organized space with room to grow.
