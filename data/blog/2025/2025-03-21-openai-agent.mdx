## SDK

- Runner

```python
result = await Runner.run(agent, input)
```

- Agent

```python
agent = Agent.from_tools(tools)
```

### Internal workflow of Runner

LLM centric approact,

In the center of the agent, we have a loop.
It runs the LLM, check the output:

- Is it a stop signal? a final output (i.e. the agent produces something of type `agent.output_type`, the loop terminates.
- Is it a tool call? call tools, and submit the tool call result to the LLM.
- Is it a handoff? if yes, run agent b
