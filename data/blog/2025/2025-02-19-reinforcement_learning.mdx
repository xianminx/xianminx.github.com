summary: Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning that involves training an agent to make sequences of decisions. The agent learns to achieve a goal in an uncertain, potentially complex environment. This article provides an overview of reinforcement learning, including key concepts, algorithms, and applications.

# Reinforcement Learning


## MDP

Reinforcement learning utilizes the MDP framework to model the interaction between a learning agent and its environment. 
In this framework, the interaction is characterized by states, actions, and rewards. The MDP framework is designed to provide a simplified representation of key elements of artificial intelligence challenges. These elements encompass the understanding of cause and effect, the management of uncertainty and nondeterminism, and the pursuit of explicit goals


cause and effect:
* states
* actions
* rewards
