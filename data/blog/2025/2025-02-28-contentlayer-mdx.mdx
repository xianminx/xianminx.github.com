## What is ContentLayer?

The workflow

1. mdx transforms to json
2. json converts to react components
3. react components render to html

Next.js uses webpack to compile and bundle the project.
ContentLayer, as a plugin, is used by next.js to process the mdx files and generate the json files. This is configured in `next.config.js`:

```javascript
import { withContentlayer } from 'next-contentlayer2'

const config = () => {
  const plugins = [withContentlayer, withBundleAnalyzer]
  return plugins.reduce((acc, next) => next(acc), {
    output,
    basePath,
    reactStrictMode: true,
    pageExtensions: ['ts', 'tsx', 'js', 'jsx', 'md', 'mdx'],
    eslint: {
        ...

```

The `withContentlayer` function is a plugin that processes the mdx files and generates the json files. The json files are then used by the React components to render the content.

Then ContentLayer as plugin, use contentlayer sdk to scan and find all md(x) files in the project, then transform them to json files.
the json files has frontmatter and body, frontmatter is the metadata of the md(x) file, body is the content of the md(x) file.
the body has `raw` and `code`
the raw field is the raw text of the content of mdx file. and the code the transformed react of the mdx file, make it possible to render the mdx file as react component. so you can embed custom react compoentn inside mdx file.

Sample json file:

```json
{
  "title": "MDX Using file based routing",
  "date": "2024-01-02T00:00:00.000Z",
  "tags": [
    "markdown",
    "github",
    "gfm",
    "mdx"
  ],
  "draft": true,
  "summary": "A demo to show using file based routing for mdx, just like regular app routing page.tsx in Next.js.",
  "authors": [
    "Lucas"
  ],
  "body": {
    "raw": "\n{/* \nimport {\n  default as ChildMDX,\n  ... actions.",
    "code": "var Component=(()=>{ ... return Component;"
  },
  ...
  "type": "Blog",
  "slug": "2025/2025-01-02-childmdx",
  "path": "blog/2025/2025-01-02-childmdx",
  "filePath": "blog/2025/2025-01-02-childmdx.mdx",
  ...
  }
```

You can customize how contentlayer transform the mdx file to json file by using `contentlayer.config.js` file.
The core function to transform the mdx file to json file is `makeSource` function.

```javascript
export default makeSource({
  contentDirPath: 'data',
  documentTypes: [Blog, Authors],
  mdx: {
    cwd: process.cwd(),
    remarkPlugins: [
      remarkExtractFrontmatter,
      remarkGfm,
      remarkCodeTitles,
      remarkMath,
      remarkImgToJsx,
      remarkAlert,
    ],
    rehypePlugins: [
      rehypeSlug,
      [
        rehypeAutolinkHeadings,
        {
          behavior: 'prepend',
          headingProperties: {
            className: ['content-header'],
          },
          content: icon,
        },
      ],
      rehypeKatex,
      rehypeKatexNoTranslate,
      [rehypeCitation, { path: path.join(root, 'data') }],
      [rehypePrismPlus, { defaultLanguage: 'js', ignoreMissing: true }],
      rehypePresetMinify,
    ],
  },
  onSuccess: async (importData) => {
    const { allBlogs } = await importData()
    createTagCount(allBlogs)
    createSearchIndex(allBlogs)
  },
})
```

When ContentLayer sdk transform the mdx file to json file, it will use the remark and rehype plugins to process the mdx file.

Then in `/app/blog/[...slug]/page.tsx` file, the json file is imported and used to render the content.

```javascript
<MDXLayoutRenderer code={post.body.code} components={components} toc={post.toc} />
```

`MDXLayoutRenderer` is a util component from `pliny` lib that render the generated code as react component.

- `code` is the transformed react component of the mdx file.
- `components` is the custom components that can be used in the mdx file.
- `toc` is the table of content of the mdx file.

So if the mdx uses custom components, the `components` prop should be passed to the `MDXLayoutRenderer` component.

Register custom components in `/components/MDXComponents.tsx` file.

```javascript
import { HelloMDX } from './HelloMDX'

export const components: MDXComponents = {

  HelloMDX,
}
```

Contentlayer is a content processing SDK that transforms your MDX files into type-safe JSON data, enabling seamless integration into your application. This transformation allows you to import MDX content as structured data, with the `body.code` field containing the React component representation of the MDX content.

**Input:**

The input to Contentlayer is your MDX files, which may include frontmatter and content. For example:

```mdx
---
title: 'Sample Post'
date: '2025-02-27'
---

# Hello, World!

This is a sample MDX post.
```

**Output:**

Contentlayer processes these MDX files and outputs JSON objects with the following structure:

```json
{
  "title": "Sample Post",
  "date": "2025-02-27",
  "body": {
    "raw": "MDX content as raw string",
    "code": "React component code representing the MDX content"
  },
  "_id": "path/to/sample-post.mdx",
  "_raw": {
    "sourceFilePath": "path/to/sample-post.mdx",
    "sourceFileName": "sample-post.mdx",
    "contentType": "mdx",
    "flattenedPath": "path/to/sample-post"
  },
  "type": "Post"
}
```

In this output:

- `title` and `date` are extracted from the frontmatter.
- `body.raw` contains the raw MDX content.
- `body.code` contains the React component code representing the MDX content.
- `_id` is a unique identifier for the document.
- `_raw` contains metadata about the source file.
- `type` indicates the document type.

**Converting a Single File Using the Command Line:**

Contentlayer primarily operates during the build process of your application, processing all specified content files. It doesn't natively provide a command-line interface (CLI) for processing individual files outside of the build process.

However, you can achieve similar functionality by setting up a custom script that processes a single MDX file. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Set Up Contentlayer Configuration:**

   Ensure your `contentlayer.config.ts` is properly configured to process your MDX files. For example:

   ```typescript
   // contentlayer.config.ts
   import { defineDocumentType, makeSource } from 'contentlayer/source-files'

   const Post = defineDocumentType(() => ({
     name: 'Post',
     filePathPattern: '**/*.mdx',
     contentType: 'mdx',
     fields: {
       title: { type: 'string', required: true },
       date: { type: 'date', required: true },
     },
     computedFields: {
       url: { type: 'string', resolve: (doc) => `/posts/${doc._raw.flattenedPath}` },
     },
   }))

   export default makeSource({
     contentDirPath: 'content',
     documentTypes: [Post],
   })
   ```

2. **Create a Custom Script:**

   Create a Node.js script that imports and processes a single MDX file using Contentlayer's internal APIs. For example:

   ```javascript
   // processMdx.js
   const { makeSource } = require('contentlayer/source-files')
   const fs = require('fs')
   const path = require('path')

   // Initialize Contentlayer source
   const source = makeSource({
     contentDirPath: 'content',
     documentTypes: [], // Specify your document types here
   })

   // Process a single MDX file
   const processMdxFile = async (filePath) => {
     const fileContent = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf-8')
     const processedContent = await source.process(fileContent)
     console.log(processedContent)
   }

   // Specify the path to your MDX file
   const mdxFilePath = path.resolve(__dirname, 'content/path/to/your/file.mdx')
   processMdxFile(mdxFilePath)
   ```

3. **Run the Script:**

   Execute the script using Node.js:

   ```bash
   node processMdx.js
   ```

This script reads the specified MDX file, processes it using Contentlayer, and outputs the processed content. You can modify the script to handle the output as needed, such as saving it to a JSON file or logging it to the console.

**Note:**

While this approach allows you to process individual MDX files, it's not the primary use case for Contentlayer. Contentlayer is designed to process all specified content files during the build process, integrating them into your application seamlessly.
