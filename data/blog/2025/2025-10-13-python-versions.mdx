# Python Version Management on macOS

There are 3 major python version managers available on macOS:

- macOS system framework

- [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

## macOS System Framework

macOS comes with a system framework for Python, located at `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions`. You can list the installed versions using:  
🧱 3. Official Python.org Installers

Best for: system-level installations (non-Homebrew users).

When you install from python.org, it places Pythons under
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.x

You can manage them manually:

ls /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/
sudo rm -rf /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.8

⚠️ But this is not recommended — hard to automate and can conflict with macOS system Python.

```sh
ls -lah /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions
drwxrwxr-x  11 root  admin   352B Jul 21  2024 3.12
lrwxr-xr-x   1 root  wheel     4B Jul 21  2024 Current -> 3.12
```
