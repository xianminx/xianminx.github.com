## What is Vibe Coding?

Wikipedia entry for [Vibe Coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding)

> [!NOTE]
> Andrej Karpathy, ... introduced the term vibe coding in February 2025. The concept refers to a coding approach that relies on LLMs, allowing programmers to generate working code by providing natural language descriptions rather than manually writing it.... "It's not really coding - I just see things, say things, run things, and copy-paste things, and it mostly works.... AI tools are not always able to fix or understand bugs, requiring him to experiment with unrelated changes until the problems are resolved.
> the technique "not too bad for throwaway weekend projects" and described it as "quite amusing"

Let me be real about vibe coding - it's basically pair programming with AI, but with a twist. Instead of two humans working together, you've got one person (the prompt engineer) throwing ideas and suggestions, while the AI does the heavy lifting of actually writing and testing the code. It's like having a coding partner who's super fast at implementation but needs your guidance on what to build.

The whole "vibe coding" thing is just a fancy name for this dynamic. As humans, we get to focus on the high-level stuff - coming up with ideas, giving feedback, and steering the direction. Meanwhile, the AI handles all the nitty-gritty coding work, testing, and debugging. It's kind of like being a tech lead who gets to focus on the big picture while having an incredibly efficient developer handling the implementation details.

## Principles of Agentic Code Development

### Current State of Vibe Coding

- **Productivity Gains**
  - Significant improvement in development speed
  - Ability to move from concept to working app quickly
- **Limitations**
  - Dependent on developer experience
  - Has its own set of challenges and gotchas

### Course Objectives

- Build real, deployed applications using AI
- Understand the importance of proper tooling
- Master effective AI communication
- Develop practical vibe coding skills

## The 5 Essential Skills for Vibe Coding

1. **Thinking Skills**

   - Logical thinking - Understanding the problem space
   - Analytical thinking - Breaking down complex problems
   - Computational thinking - Identifying patterns and algorithms
   - Procedural thinking - Planning step-by-step solutions

2. **Framework**

   - Choosing appropriate frameworks for the task
   - Understanding framework capabilities with LLMs
   - Leveraging framework features effectively

3. **Checkpoint**

   - Using version control effectively
   - Creating restore points before major changes
   - Breaking development into manageable chunks
   - Regular testing and validation

4. **Debugging**

   - Systematic and methodical debugging
   - Root cause analysis
   - Testing hypotheses
   - Iterative problem solving
   - Making debugging engaging and productive

5. **Context**
   - Maintaining relevant context for LLMs
   - Clear communication of requirements
   - Understanding system limitations
   - Managing scope and complexity

### Building Your MVP

- Focus on core functionality first
- Provide only MVP-relevant context to LLMs
- Start with small, achievable milestones
- Iterate and expand gradually
- Validate each development phase

## Lab Projects

### Project 1: SEO Optimizer

**Objective**: Create an interactive app that analyzes and visualizes SEO tags for any website.

> [!NOTE]
> Help me create an interactive app that displays the SEO (meta) tags for any website in an interactive and visual way to check that
> they're properly implemented.
> The app should fetch the HTML for a site, then provide feedback on SEO tags in accordance with best practices for SEO optimization.
> The app should give google and Social media previews
> **Requirements**:

- Fetch and parse HTML from input URLs
- Analyze SEO meta tags
- Provide visual feedback on tag implementation
- Show Google and social media previews
- Follow SEO best practices

**Success Criteria**:

- Accurate tag extraction
