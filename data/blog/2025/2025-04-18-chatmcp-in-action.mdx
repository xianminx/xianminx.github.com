## MCP Client

ChatMCP

a flutter app that uses the MCP protocol to communicate with a server. It is a simple chat application that allows users to send and receive messages.

it supports multiple platforms including android, ios, web, and desktop.

In this tutorial, I will use ChatMCP for macos to demonstrate the MCP protocol in action.

installation

```bash
Ξ Application Support/ChatMcp → pwd
/Users/lucas/Library/Application Support/ChatMcp
Ξ Application Support/ChatMcp → tree
