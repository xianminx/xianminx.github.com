After updating to Mountain Lion, many command line tools disappeared. The solution is described here:  
[Git “Command Not Found” Error In Mountain Lion [Quickfix]](http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/mountain-lion-git-fix/).

It may take a long time to download and install the huge XCode (1.6G, about 1 hour for me).

Happy luck:)
