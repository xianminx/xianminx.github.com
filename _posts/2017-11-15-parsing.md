## Context-free grammar
G = <T,N, S,R>
• T is set of terminals (lexicon)
• N is set of non-terminals For NLP, we usually distinguish out a set
P  N of preterminals which always rewrite as terminals.
• S is start symbol (one of the nonterminals)
• R is rules/productions of the form X ! 
, where X is a nonterminal
and 
 is a sequence of terminals and nonterminals (may be empty).
• A grammar G generates a language L.
